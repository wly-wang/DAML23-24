    "\n",
    "This lab is a guided walkthrough to build a _basic_ 'image classification' DNN model and train it on some data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we build up our model we will build a familiarity with the various components and strategies for building such an ANN system.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have been able to do this we will then save and load our now-trained model from disk and use it to make a prediction on a new image which isn't present in the original dataset.\n",

    "* Try and calculate the answers to the exercises provided. If you are unable to complete the question, describe which approach you _would_ have taken to solve the problem\n",
    "* Code must be understandable and reproducible. Before grading the notebook kernel **may** be restarted and re-run, so make sure that your code can run from start to finish without any (unintentional) errors\n",
    "* If you are unsure on how to proceed please **ask one of the TAs** during the workshop\n",
    " - Notebooks should be submitted by **10am on Friday 13th October**\n",
    " - This notebook starts with problem 0. This is not assessed, but it is a helpful exercise to show some of the potential pitfalls of 'trusting algorithms' to do the work for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are 10 sections involved in building a DNN using TensorFlow, trainig it on data and then using it to predict based on a new piece of data never seen by the model before.\n",
    "* There are 2 bonus sections covering 'additional training of a model' and 'the impact of training on the distribution of internal weights within a DNN'. These have bonus points if you manage to finish them, but the final mark is capped at 10.\n"
